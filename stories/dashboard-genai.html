<p>
  Great dashboards are powerful. They centralize metrics, visualize trends, and
  help organizations monitor performance.
</p>

<p>
  But a question we often ask our customers is:
  <strong>What if you could talk to your dashboards?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  At <strong>Source Node Technologies</strong>, we believe meaningful innovation
  starts with listening - not just to data, but to the people using it. We take
  the time to deeply understand our customers journeys, their expectations, and
  the gaps that quietly emerge even after significant technology investments.
</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>
  One such gap surfaced during our engagement with an enterprise client that had
  invested heavily in analytics. Over time, they had built
  <strong>100+ Power BI dashboards</strong>, each carefully designed to serve
  different teams and business functions.
</p>

<p>
  The dashboards were robust. The data was structured. The metrics were trusted.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, when the organization began exploring a
  <strong>GenAI-powered conversational experience</strong>, they hit a wall.
</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
  Despite having rich, structured data, the dashboards could not be directly
  leveraged by large language models in a reliable and performant way.
</div>

<p>The result was a familiar enterprise dilemma:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dashboards answered predefined questions</li>
  <li>Executives wanted conversational, exploratory insights</li>
  <li>Rebuilding analytics from scratch was not an option</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Simply exposing raw data to an LLM was neither safe nor scalable. And
  recreating business logic outside Power BI would break trust in existing
  reporting.
</p>

<h2>Rethinking the Approach</h2>

<p>
  Instead of asking, <em>“How do we rebuild analytics for GenAI?”</em>, we asked
  a different question:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    “How do we help GenAI understand the analytics that already exist?”
  </strong>
</p>

<p>
  Our approach focused on unlocking value from existing investments - not
  replacing them.
</p>

<h3>1. Translating Dashboards into Semantic Intelligence</h3>

<p>
  Power BI dashboards are driven by DAX expressions that encode deep business
  logic. However, DAX is not natively understandable by LLMs.
</p>

<p>
  We solved this by implementing a
  <strong>DAX-to-semantic conversion layer</strong> - translating complex
  calculations, relationships, and measures into a semantic representation that
  large language models can reason over accurately.
</p>

<div class="story-media">

    src="./assets/power-bi.jpg"
    alt="DAX to Semantic Conversion Architecture"
  />
</div>

<p>
  This ensured that when the GenAI system responded to a query, it was grounded
  in the same logic users already trusted inside their dashboards.
</p>

<h3>2. Designing a Multi-LLM Architecture</h3>

<p>
  Not all GenAI tasks are the same - and expecting a single model to handle
  everything often leads to poor performance and high costs.
</p>

<p>We designed a <strong>multi-LLM architecture</strong> where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One model focused on intent understanding</li>
  <li>Another handled semantic reasoning over structured data</li>
  <li>A response model ensured clarity, accuracy, and context</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This separation of responsibility allowed the system to remain fast, reliable,
  and scalable - even when interacting with complex analytical queries.
</p>

    alt="Multi LLM Architecture for Conversational Analytics"
  />
</div>

<h2>The Outcome</h2>

<p>
  The result was a <strong>GenAI-powered conversational bot</strong> that could:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Answer natural language questions over Power BI data</li>
  <li>Respect existing business logic and definitions</li>
  <li>Deliver fast, context-aware responses</li>
  <li>Operate without compromising performance or reliability</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
  Most importantly, the solution unlocked the full potential of existing
  analytics investments - transforming dashboards from static visuals into
  interactive conversations.
</div>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>
  This engagement wasn't about adding GenAI for the sake of innovation. It was
  about making data
  <strong>more accessible, more intuitive, and more impactful</strong> for
  decision-makers.
</p>

<p>
  That's what we mean by creating real impact: helping organizations extract
  exponentially more value from the systems they already trust.
</p>

<p>
  If your organization has invested heavily in analytics but struggles to make
  data truly conversational and actionable, we'd love to explore how we can
  help.
