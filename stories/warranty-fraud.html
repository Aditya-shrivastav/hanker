<p>
  Warranty claim fraud is a silent drain on enterprise profitability. Across
  industries, organizations lose millions each year to inflated, manipulated, or
  entirely fraudulent warranty claims.
</p>

<p>
  At <strong>Source Node Technologies</strong>, we set out to solve this problem
  not just with advanced models - but with a system that could be trusted,
  adopted, and scaled across the organization.
</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>
  Traditional warranty fraud detection relies heavily on manual checks, rigid
  rules, and retrospective audits.
</p>

<p>This creates three persistent problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fraud is detected <strong>after</strong> payouts are made</li>
  <li>Claim officers depend on IT or data science teams for analysis</li>
  <li>Operational teams are overwhelmed by false positives</li>
</ul>

<p>
  What organizations needed was a system that could
  <strong>identify risk early</strong>,
  <strong>scale across large claim volumes</strong>, and
  <strong>empower business users directly</strong>.
</p>

<h2>The Solution: AI-Driven Fraud Detection on Databricks</h2>

<p>
  We built a <strong>Warranty Claim Fraud Detection Model</strong>, deployed on
  <strong>Databricks</strong>, using proven classical AI and machine learning
  techniques.
</p>

<p>
  Instead of relying on opaque black-box systems, our approach focused on
  transparency, explainability, and operational usability.
</p>

<h3>Empowering Claim Officers</h3>

<p>
  One of our primary goals was to remove dependency on IT and data science teams
  for day-to-day fraud detection.
</p>

<p>
  The solution includes an <strong>intuitive user interface</strong>
  that allows claim officers to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand why a claim is flagged</li>
  <li>Explore risk factors visually</li>
  <li>Make confident, data-driven decisions independently</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
  Fraud detection works best when intelligence is placed directly in the hands
  of the people making decisions.
</div>

<h3>Delivering Massive ROI</h3>

<p>
  By identifying fraudulent claims <strong>before payout</strong>, the system
  delivers immediate and measurable financial impact.
</p>

<p>
  Classical AI & ML techniques - when applied thoughtfully - have proven highly
  effective in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reducing financial leakage</li>
  <li>Lowering false-positive rates</li>
  <li>Improving operational efficiency</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In real deployments, organizations have saved
  <strong>millions in prevented losses</strong>, turning fraud detection from a
  cost center into a value driver.
</p>

<h3>Built to Adapt and Scale</h3>

<p>
  No two organizations face the same fraud patterns. That's why the framework
  was designed to be
  <strong>highly customizable</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  It can evolve from a focused warranty fraud solution into a broader
  <strong>anomaly detection platform</strong>, covering:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Supplier fraud</li>
  <li>Operational anomalies</li>
  <li>Process deviations</li>
</ul>

<h2>See the Model in Action</h2>

<p>
  The real power of the solution is best understood when you see it in action.

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>This is just the beginning.</p>

<p>We're actively building upcoming Proofs of Concept that integrate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GenAI for conversational fraud investigation</li>
  <li>Agentic AI for proactive anomaly detection</li>
  <li>Next-generation AI & ML techniques</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Together, these innovations will push fraud detection from reactive
  identification to proactive prevention.
</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
  AI-driven fraud detection succeeds when it balances intelligence with
  usability, and sophistication with trust.
